## Development

Sylvester is built using `jake` and tested with JS.Test. Tests should run on all
target platforms, including browsers, Node and other JS runtimes.

Install the build tools (requires Rubygems)

    $ gem install bundler
    $ bundle install

To build the library from source:

    $ bundle exec jake

To test, run using various JS binaries and open the tests in the browser:

    $ JS=(v8 node spidermonkey rhino narwhal ringo)
    $ for js in "${JS[@]}"; do echo "$js" ; $js test/console.js ; echo $? ; done

    $ cscript.exe test/console.js # on Windows

    $ open test/browser.html

To view the website locally:
